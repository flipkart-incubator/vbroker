*** Generating Flatbuffers schema
    (this is already generated)
    - From root directory of the project, run:
      /code/src/oss/flatbuffers/flatc -o ./core/src/main/java/ --java schema/message.fbs
    - The above should put the Message.java file under the project src/main/java directory

*** Generating Protobuf classes
    - From root directory run:
     protoc -I schema --java_out=core/src/main/java/ schema/entities.proto schema/requests.proto schema/responses.proto
