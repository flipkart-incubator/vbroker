*** Generating Flatbuffers schema
    (this is already generated)
    - From root directory of the project, run:
      /code/src/oss/flatbuffers/flatc -o ./core/src/main/java/ --java schema/message.fbs
    - The above should put the Message.java file under the project src/main/java directory

*** Generating Protobuf classes
    - Ensure that you have protoc version 3.5.1. If not, get it from [[https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.5.1][here]]
    - From root directory run:
     protoc -I schema --java_out=core/src/main/java/ schema/entities.proto schema/requests.proto schema/responses.proto
    - This will generate all protocol classes.

*** Building the project
    ./gradlew build

*** Running the server
    From IntelliJ, run VBrokerServer

*** Sending message from a client and getting response
    From IntelliJ, run VBrokerClient - it sends a sample message and gets it
